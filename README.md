# Image-classification-by-using-Transfer-Learning-with-MobileNet-
This project is used for classification. In this project, I implemented a transfer learning technique for classification, and the pre-trained model I used is mobileNetV2. MobileNetV2 was trained on ImageNet and is optimized to run on mobile and other low-power applications. It has 155 layers. The architecture has three defining characteristics:  1.Depthwise separable convolutions 2.Thin input and output bottlenecks between layers 3.Shortcut connections between bottleneck layers Apart from transfer learning, I implement the data augmentation technique in the preprocessing and fine-tuning of the model and get an accuracy of above 98%.
